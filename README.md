# taskmon.ai

Inspiration
-----------

* * * * *

The inspiration for this project was to create a task management system that utilizes artificial intelligence to efficiently manage projects.

What it does
------------

* * * * *

The Task Management System with AI PMO is a project management tool that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data and make predictions about project outcomes. It helps project managers to prioritize tasks, improve resource allocation, and increase productivity.

How I built it
--------------

* * * * *

The system was built using Python and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The frontend was developed using React, while the backend was built using Node.js and Express.

Challenges I ran into
---------------------

* * * * *

One of the major challenges was training the machine learning models with sufficient data. We also faced some difficulties in integrating the frontend with the backend.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
---------------------------------

* * * * *

We are proud of building a functional project management tool that can significantly improve the efficiency of project management. We were able to successfully integrate machine learning algorithms into the system, which can make accurate predictions about project outcomes.

What I learned
--------------

* * * * *

We learned a lot about machine learning algorithms and their applications in project management. We also gained valuable experience in frontend and backend development.

What's next for Task management system with AI PMO
--------------------------------------------------

* * * * *

In the future, we plan to improve the accuracy of the machine learning models by incorporating more data sources. We also plan to add more features to the system, such as automated reporting and risk management.
